<h1>The @PKG_NAME@ package  (version @MAJOR_VERSION@.@MINOR_VERSION@-@PATCH_LEVEL@)</h1>


This package provides access to the Windows registry from within R.
It allows one to query and set values within the registry by
navigating the registry via its hierarchical paths.  One can also
create and delete keys.  These facilities can be used when installing
packages, etc.  to populate the registry without requiring C code in
those packages. More importantly, it allows us to author R code that
can find out about user settings, characteristics of installed
software (e.g. versions, installation directories) and to use those
directly rather than requiring the user to specify them (again).  One
of the motivations for developing this was to allow lookup of Class
IDs for COM to be used with the <a
href="../RDCOMClient">RDCOMClient</a> package.





<h2><a name="Download">Download</a></h2>

We provide both a <a href="@TAR_FILE@">source version</a> and a <a
